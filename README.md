# Project Overview: AppointmentInsight
In collaboration with the National Health Services (NHS), the AppointmentInsight project seeks to address the challenges associated with missed general practitioner (GP) appointments, a concern identified as a significant financial burden on the NHS. Led by a team of data analysts, the project aims to delve into the complexities of appointment no-shows, providing data-driven insights and recommendations to enhance healthcare access and resource utilization.
# Data Analysis and Insights: Unveiling Trends and Patterns in NHS Appointment Records
I began by converting data files from Excel to CSV for faster importing. I imported necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization. DataFrames were created for various files, and initial checks for missing values and duplicates were performed. Data types, statistics, and information summaries were generated for each DataFrame. Duplicates in one DataFrame were retained due to their small proportion.

Next, I imported the datetime module to standardize date formats across DataFrames. I introduced four percentage calculations to enhance analysis. The data showed no missing values, leading to the identification of top locations based on record counts, with London having the highest.

Further analysis involved using the value_counts() function to identify the top 5 locations with the highest number of records. Although London had the highest count, the specific content of appointments was not detailed. The analysis continued with specific breakdowns for Appointment Status, Healthcare Professional, Mode of Appointment, and Time between Booking and Appointment.

Upon examining data tables, there were no missing values, and the analysis shifted to exploring the relationship between the NHS and patients. I identified top locations based on record counts and emphasized the need for a detailed examination of appointment specifics.

The data analysis involved printing initial appointment dates, converting date formats, and noting variations in appointment numbers throughout 2021. Between January and June 2022, general practice was identified as the most widely utilized service in NHS North West London, highlighting fluctuations in demand over time.

# Data Visualization Insights: Unveiling Appointment Trends and Service Utilization in NHS
I begin by setting up the plotting environment using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries for data visualization. I conduct data pre-processing tasks, including changing the data type for 'appointment month' in the national category and aggregating data on a monthly level. In the first visualization, I observe that General practice had the highest number of appointments in November 2021, with the 'unmapped' category showing a significant number of appointments. Within General practice, General Consultation Acute and General Consultation Routine had the highest demand.

I divide the data by seasons and focus on specific periods, noting a significant decrease in the 'unmapped' section from August 2021 to April 2022. I use barplots and lineplots for their simplicity and effectiveness in comparing categories over time. The visualizations are enhanced with appropriate labels, grid, color palette, and customized legends. Date format is changed for clarity, and bar values are displayed using a 'for loop.' Extra visualizations, such as seasonal lineplots excluding 'General Practice,' reveal patterns of appointments rising and falling over a seven-day period. Four seasonal lineplots for daily appointments are also created to understand NHS resource utilization.

# Optimizing Healthcare Efficiency: A Data-Driven Analysis and Recommendations

Analysis of appointment data reveals that daily utilization never exceeds 1,200,000 appointments per month, but the daily distribution varies significantly. Increasing staff on busy days or spreading appointments evenly across the week is suggested. For attended appointments, 90-95% were attended, with missed GP appointments having a notable economic impact. Extended wait times contribute to higher rates of missed GP appointments, emphasizing the need to address factors causing delays. Recommendations include optimizing scheduling practices, hiring additional staff during peak periods, and implementing effective appointment reminder systems. Data consistency and accuracy are crucial for comprehensive resource planning.
